Some gPhoto2 utilities (Linux scrips) to help you control your DSLR from the command line.
Mainly thought to be used with **Nikon** DSLRs

## What can I do?
- Capture single photos and movies (by giving the duration in seconds)
- Download all the photos skipping all the already-downloaded photos. Also with sync: let gPhoto2 download all photos continually while they are being captured (ideal for intervalometers).
- Download only the latest photo
- Move the focus point
- Live view (VLC)
- Intervalometer mode (shooot and m-shooot). **Also in Bulb mode!**
- Manipulate aperture, ISO, shutter speed, viewfinder, automatic dark setting
- Get battery level, focal length and image format from the camera
- Get a summary of all the camera config
- Look for DSLRs
- Convert RAW images (UFRaw)

**Without having to remember gPhoto2 commands!**

### Command line arguments to scripts?
You'll be asked interactively, so you don't have to remember them!
